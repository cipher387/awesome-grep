Grep is a command line utility that searches files for lines that match a regular expression. 


[How regular expressions can be useful in OSINT. Theory and some practice using Google Sheets](https://medium.com/@cyb_detective/this-article-consists-of-three-short-parts-31d31efabd5)

The first version of this utility appeared almost 50 years ago, in 1973. But it is still actively used and maintained (the last version was released in August 2021! https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grep/).

This repository contains various modifications of grep, as well as analogues of this utility for a wide variety of search tasks.

<hr>

To get the most out of the grep utilities mentioned above, use them along with sed and awk (and add some Perl in particularly difficult cases).
